  git clone https://github.com/matteodedonno02/LOLlu.git
  ```
- ```
  cp config.py.example config.py
  ```

- Replace **players** with an existing players list.

- Replace **RIOT_KEY** with your riot api key.

- Replace **BOT_KEY** with your telegram bot key and **CHAT_ID** with your telegram chat id or telegram group chat id

 - Run command

    ```
    docker-compose up
    ```

    that build image and run container

## Is it necessary for such a simple little program to use docker?

No but dockerizing is so funny :whale2: :whale2:
